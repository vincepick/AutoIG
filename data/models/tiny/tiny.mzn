$ Updated model based on your requirements

$ input 'b'
int: b;

$ Declare variables with their respective domains
var 3..30: x;
var 0..6: y;
var 10..100000: z;

$ Constraints to link 'x' and 'a', and define the relationship between 'x', 'y', and 'z'
constraint x = b;        $ Ensure 'x' is equal to 'a'
constraint z = x + y;    $ Define 'z' as the sum of 'x' and 'y'

$ Solve the model by satisfying all constraints
solve satisfy;
